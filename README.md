# üõ°Ô∏è Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Web Application

A full-stack machine learning‚Äìbased IDS built with Python (Flask), Scapy, PyShark, and Tailwind CSS. This project detects network intrusions by classifying packets as **Attack** or **Normal** using a trained ML model and offers multiple modes of input: manual, CSV-based, and real-time live capture.

## üìå Features

- üîê **Login Authentication Page**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Manual Feature Entry** ‚Äì Enter 41 features manually to get predictions
- üìÇ **CSV File Upload** ‚Äì Upload a dataset and classify multiple entries
- üåê **Real-Time Packet Capture** ‚Äì Select a network interface to sniff packets and detect live threats
- üìä **Table-Based Results** ‚Äì Color-coded tabular output (green for normal, red for attack)
- üì° **Interface Detection** ‚Äì Dynamically fetches available network interfaces
- üé® **Neon-styled UI** ‚Äì Built using Tailwind CSS and responsive HTML

## üß† How It Works

- **Manual Entry:** Accepts 41 features to classify a single data point.
- **CSV Upload:** Reads a CSV with 41 columns, applies the model, returns a prediction for each row.
- **Live Capture:** Uses Scapy or PyShark to sniff packets from a selected interface and classifies them on the fly.
